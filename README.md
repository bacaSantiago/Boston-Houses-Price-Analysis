# Analysis of Influential Factors on Housing Values in Boston

---

## Overview

This project presents an in-depth analysis of the Boston housing dataset, focusing on identifying the most influential features that impact the median value of owner-occupied homes (`medv`). The analysis combines various advanced statistical, mathematical, and machine learning methods, such as correlation analysis and feature importance using Random Forests. Additionally, the project incorporates sophisticated data visualization techniques, including scatter plots, kernel density estimates (KDE), Andrew's curves, Radviz, and Chernoff faces, to explore relationships between key variables and `medv`.

The primary goal is to uncover the main features that affect housing prices in Boston and visualize their significance. By analyzing the dataset through various multivariate techniques, this project provides a comprehensive view of housing characteristics and their impact on value.

## Core Concepts

### 1. **Correlation Analysis**

- The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to measure the linear relationship between each feature and the target variable `medv`. Features were ranked based on their absolute correlation to identify those with the strongest associations.

### 2. **Random Forest Feature Importance**

- A Random Forest model was trained multiple times to assess the importance of each feature in predicting the target variable `medv`. The importance scores were averaged across several iterations to reduce bias. This model helps in understanding which features contribute the most to housing value predictions.

### 3. **Multivariate Visualization**

- **Scatter Plots & Pair Plots**: Used to observe relationships between selected features and `medv`.
- **Kernel Density Estimates (KDE)**: Visualizes the distribution of features and identifies patterns, including skewness and multimodal distributions.
- **Boxplots**: Displayed the spread of the data and outliers within each feature.
- **Andrew's Curves**: Highlighted high-dimensional data structure, allowing observation of patterns and clusters.
- **Radviz Plot**: Provided a way to represent multivariate relationships in a 2D space, showing how features interact and cluster based on their values.

### 4. **Chernoff Faces**

- This technique represents multivariate data as human faces, where each feature corresponds to a specific facial characteristic. It serves as an intuitive way to identify patterns and similarities between different observations based on selected features.

## Key Features Analyzed

The following features were identified as the most influential through correlation and feature importance analysis:

- **crim**: Per capita crime rate.
- **dis**: Weighted distances to five Boston employment centers.
- **indus**: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
- **lstat**: Percentage of the population with low socioeconomic status.
- **rm**: Average number of rooms per dwelling.
- **ptratio**: Pupil-teacher ratio by town.

## Applications

This project has broad applications in areas such as:

- **Real Estate Valuation**: By identifying which features most significantly impact property prices, this model can be used by real estate agents and city planners to estimate housing values.
- **Urban Planning**: The analysis provides insights into how socioeconomic and infrastructural factors influence housing markets, guiding urban development strategies.
- **Machine Learning Research**: The integration of feature selection techniques and visualization can be applied to various regression and classification tasks in other domains.

## Summary of Findings

1. **Data Exploration**: The dataset was clean, containing no missing values. Variability in features like `crim`, `tax`, and `lstat` was significant, while some features showed normal distributions (e.g., `rm`).
2. **Relationships**:
   - A **positive relationship** was observed between `rm` (average number of rooms) and `medv` (housing value).
   - A **negative relationship** between `lstat` (low socioeconomic status) and `medv` was one of the strongest in the dataset.
3. **Feature Importance**: `rm` and `lstat` were found to be the most influential features in predicting housing prices, followed by `dis` and `ptratio`.
4. **Visualization Insights**:
   - **Andrewâ€™s Curves and Radviz**: Identified distinct groupings based on housing value, showing how features like `rm` and `lstat` shape these clusters.
   - **Chernoff Faces**: Provided a visual summary of multivariate data, showing variability and patterns among different housing observations.

## Recommendations

- **Outlier Analysis**: Some features, particularly `crim` and `tax`, contained significant outliers. A more detailed analysis of these outliers is recommended to understand their potential impact on model performance.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Future analysis could benefit from interactive tools like Tableau or Plotly to allow users to explore the data dynamically.

## Conclusion

The analysis highlights the importance of features like the number of rooms (`rm`) and socioeconomic status (`lstat`) in determining housing prices in Boston. Advanced visualization techniques have made it possible to uncover patterns and relationships that may otherwise remain hidden. This methodology can be extended to similar datasets in other regions or used to assess the impact of future urban development projects on property values.
